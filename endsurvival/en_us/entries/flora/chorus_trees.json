As they grow, chorus trees branch outwards, carrying their flower higher and higher, eventually splitting it off into duplicates through a bewildering mitotic process. Most trees seem to bear 1-8 flowers, with the numbers being highly variable and dependent on available space."

Consuming chorus fruit therefore poses a minor yet life-threatening risk of contracting Typhus Fever alongside the typical warping effects of the bacterium. Survivors should only eat this food source as a last resort against starvation."
